Sample projects for presentation

There are two Xamarin solutions, Doctors and DoctorsXF.  The Doctors solution contains a simple list of the various actors who have protrayed Doctor Who on the BBC.  There are versions for Android, iPhone, and Windows Phone 8.  They share the same data, in a PCL, but use native UI controls and navigation.

The DoctorsXF solution has the same app, written in Xamarin.Forms.
